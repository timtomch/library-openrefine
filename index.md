This lesson is a short introduction to [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org),
a tool that is used to explore and "clean up" structured data.
The example used in this lesson is an excerpt from a database of research articles.
Even though the lesson was developed with librarians in mind, the concepts introduced
should be applicable to other topics as well.

The lesson materials are based on the [Library Carpentry OpenRefine for librarians lesson](https://data-lessons.github.io/library-openrefine/) (work in progress).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> No particular skills are required to follow this lesson, although a general knowledge of
> structured data (e.g. spreadsheets) is certainly useful.
